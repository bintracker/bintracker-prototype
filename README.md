# about bintracker

Bintracker is a free, open source, modular, cross-platform music editor for low-level sound drivers, and a visual front-end for the [Music Data Abstraction Language (MDAL)](https://utz82.github.io/MDAL). It is released under a 3-clause BSD license.

Currently, bintracker supports a number of modern 1-bit (beeper) music drivers for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K home computer, including betaphase, PhaserX, PhaseSqueek, and Pytha. Additional drivers can easily be added via the MDAL configuration plug-in system.

Bintracker is confirmed to run on Windows and Linux. It should also be possible to build it on MacOS, though this is untested.
